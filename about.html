    <h2>Brian Nelson</h2>
        <p>I am a retired army vet that has been dedicated to bringing the best ouf of people. With having such a compassionate heart for animals and people a like.
            My ultimate goal with this company was to make a place for people to feel safe and wanted after a year and half of isolation. It's hard to be without human 
            interaction after being in lockdown. So my co-partner Connor and I wanted to make it soe everyone in Washington could ease back into the flow of being a washingtonian. 
        </p>
     <h2>Connor Boyce</h2>  
        <p>Hello! My Name is as you guessed Connor Boyce. Being in this new post pandemic world has got a lot of us anxious to see new people and have genuine experiences. 
            The reason I wanted to partner up with Brian Nelson was to give people options to explore their great state of Washington. I've lived in Washington for about 13 years.  
            Plus I love the outdoors and downtown Seattle. So much to do with all the time in the world after Covid.    
        </p>
        <p>With lack of human interaction this will be a a great way for your family and friends to interact with your community and have blast all in one service. </p>
